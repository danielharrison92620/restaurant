# Restaurant
This application aims to solve the problem of food ordering in restaurants, where users have to scan through menus usually in paper form, place order and make payment at the point of sales afterwards. This application will ensure orders can be placed from the phone after scanning a barcode which represents the restaurant URL. Payment will be made right after the order has been place through some payment gateway and there will also be an option to pay at the point of sales.
